"""Student kernels for the SGEMM autograder assignment.

You implement K2 (GMEM coalescing), K3 (shared-memory blocking), K4 (1D
register tiling), and K5 (2D register tiling) inside this file. The launch
wrappers, tile-size constants, and signatures are provided — you only edit
the kernel bodies marked TODO.

K1 (naive) is given as a worked example so you have a reference for the
numba.cuda @cuda.jit signature every kernel must match.

To check correctness locally before submitting:
    python sanity_check.py

To submit: push your edits to the main branch of this assignment repo.
Each push that touches kernels.py triggers the autograder, which runs
on a Modal A100 40GB and posts your grade as a comment on the commit.
You have 5 graded submissions per assignment.
